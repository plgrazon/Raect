# Raect

Raect tries to be a JavaScript libary but it will never be.

- **Declarative:** Raect makes it painless to create interactive UIs because you don't need to do anything.

- **Component-Based:** No components, no state, no problem.

- **Learn Once:** Get the spelling right next time.

## Examples:

```javascript
let { raect } = require('raect');

raect();
```
